# Numerical Analysis in SAS

With the rapid growth of processing speed in the everyday computer, scientific calculations are becoming more accessible to people who may not necessarily specialise in computing or information technology. An important type of calculation is found in numerical analysis - normally, analytical techniques are used to solve problems, but in some cases, the problem is too complex for our current accumulation of mathematical knowledge to solve. We thus create workarounds, through several different methods. Here is a collection of some of these methods, as applied in the programming language of SAS<sup>®</sup>.

See www.sas.com for more information on SAS<sup>®</sup>-related products, since this repository will focus on the mathematics and is not affiliated with the SAS Institute. The SAS Institute has a few interesting online courses for beginners.

The programs in this repository run on **SAS/IML 15.2** and **SAS 9.4**.
